Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

# Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools in the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
Software engineering follows the journey of software applications from the designing, development, testing to the maintenance stage.

# Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


# List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) follows through the phase of gathering requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment to the maintenance phase.
Requirement: This phase of the SDLC involves gathering of requirements for the software projects. These requirements include user needs, system requirements, etc
Design: This phase is the prototyping stage. It involves the creation of detailed designs for software architecture, user interface. It usually includes the wireframes of the software applications.
Implementation: This is the phase where the actual development of the software applications takes place. It involves writing codes and building the project based on design specifications.
Testing: This phase involves testing the software to ascertain that it meets quality standard and functional requirements.
Deployment: This phase involves making the software applications ready to customers (or users) for use.
Maintenance: This phase involves continuous improvement of the software application through support and updates (enhancement or addition of features, fixing bugs, etc.) 

# Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile model of software development follows an iterative and incremental approaches to software development, while waterfall model of software development 
follows a linear, sequential approach to software development through the SDLC. 
The key difference between agile and waterfall models are their approach to software development, predictability, adaptability to changes (project needs, scope creep) and team dynamics where agile model is flexible, waterfall model is rigid and where agile model fosters collaboration, waterfall model has some shortcomings.
Agile model might be preferred in fast-paced production environment with changing project and users’ needs (such as shopping platform dev.). And, the waterfall model might be preferred in scenarios with fixed project outline from start to finish.

# Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: 

Quality Assurance Engineer:

Project manager: 
The project manager is responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. Basically, a project manager leads a development team in achieving all project goals within the specified time constraints. 
Some of the responsibilities of managing software projects as a project manager are project monitoring and control, timely delivery of software projects, cost control, resource and risk management, quality assurance and ensuring stakeholder satisfaction.


# Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Version control systems are software tools that track changes made to source codes. Version control systems are important in software development as they not only source codes changes but facilitate work coordination amongst development team members. Git and subversion are examples of version control system. These examples of version control control systems are have unique features. For instance, the Git is a distributed version control system with fast commit speeds. Git also support offline work mode. Git is flexible and advanced, however, with steeper learning curve. Apache subversion (commonly known as subversion) is a centralized version control system with files and data stored on central servers. It is beginner-friendly in terms of ease of use but with limited offline work mode.

# What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some of the challenges that software engineers faces include tight deadlines, changing requirements of the software projects, technical debt and so on. Technical debt is simply the 
Challenges with managing software projects include poor planning and unrealistic deadlines, changing requirements (scope creep), resource allocation, project delay due to resource unavailability, lack of accountability (in team members), team communication issues, and many among others.

# Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
The different types of software testing are as follows:
Unit testing: This type of testing involves the testing of individual component and module of the software.
Integration testing: This involves testing the interaction between different components or subsystem of the software.
System testing: This involves the overall testing of the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance testing: This type of testing deals with testing the software against user requirements to ensure that the acceptance criteria based on users’ needs are ticked off.
Testing is essential in software quality assurance as this phase helps in ensuring that the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.

# Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
